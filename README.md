# SplitsBill

## About the Project
Ordering food as a group is a challenge--It's difficult to keep track of what each person ordered, how much each item cost, and the total per person once tax and tip are applied. SplitsBill solves these problems by allowing a host to create a party and invite her fellow diners as guests. Guests submit their orders as individual items with quantity and cost; once all orders are submitted to the party, the app does the math, calculating tax and tip and providing a total cost per guest. The host can then send guests their payment app details, making the payback process quick and painless.
